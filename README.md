# Bio-Inspired-Flapping-Mechanism-Underwater-Vehicle
A bio-inspired, servo-driven underwater vehicle using sinusoidal flapping fins for efficient, low-disturbance propulsion. Features gear- and servo-based actuation, ballast control, and validated hydrodynamic design

#Problem Addressed
Conventional underwater vehicles rely on propellers, which disturb water and reduce visibility.
Underwater inspection, surveillance, and tracking are limited due to poor maneuverability.
There is a need for energy-efficient, stable underwater motion for research and monitoring tasks.

#Objectives
Develop a lightweight, affordable ROUV for marine applications.
Achieve high hydrodynamic efficiency using bio-inspired flapping fins.
Enable underwater vision, monitoring, intelligence gathering, and tracking.

#Proposed Technology / Solution
Replace traditional propellers with flapping foil mechanisms mimicking fish-tail hydrodynamics.
Two flapping mechanisms proposed:
Gear-based mechanism
Servo-based mechanism (fins attached directly to servo horns)
Use sinusoidal motion; tune amplitude, phase, and frequency for maximum thrust.
Design includes four fins (two forward, two backward) for lift and propulsion.
